Well, he once was more popular than <strong><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></strong> on social media. The E! reality star, who is now considered one of the most influential people on social media, only had 856 friends and 73 wall comments on her amazingly pink Myspace account back in 2006. Oh, she also was simply known as “Princess Kimberly” and used pimp-my-profile.com to create her layout.</p><p>She wanted to meet “God,” was thinking of having children “someday,” and her hero was her “daddy.”&nbsp;</p><p>The 5’3” then-25-year-old straight Libra, who didn’t smoke or drink, was in a relationship and solely looking for friends. “I’m a princess and you’re not so there!” her bio read.<img decoding=async width=467 height=302 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Kim Kardashian old Myspace profile" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In case you’re not up to date on your Kardashian timeline, when <strong>Kanye West</strong>’s now-wife was 25, she was dating <strong>Ray J</strong> — who was listed as one of her top friends on her account mind you! — and her now infamous sex tape had yet to be released. Meaning, Princess Kimberly was still <strong>Paris Hilton</strong>’s sidekick and had yet to make her reality TV debut on Keeping Up With the Kardashians. (That all came in 2007.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Fast-forward to 2015 — and millions of dollars later — and Kardashian has long settled a lawsuit with Ray J for allegedly leaking their sex tape without her consent, she’s no longer friends with Paris Hilton, and she’s a mother with another child on the way. Not to mention, she’s credited as a social media maven, with almost 70 million combined followers on Instagram and Twitter, and she’s the creator of one of the highest ranking mobile apps, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood.</p><p>“Social media works when you’re open, when you’re honest and people want to feel like they’re getting a little glimpse into your life,” Princess Kimberly 2.0 told <a href=#>AdWeek</a> in a March 2015 interview. “It’s not that I brand myself like I’m a celebrity. It’s just I’m living my life and sharing a part of my life with the world.”&nbsp;</p><p>You do you, Princess Kimberly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKipV2grrOwwKyfopmeYsSiv4yopZydXaC7sMPNZpisZaCntq%2BvxKyqZqOZoq%2BmvsuyZKimXZ2ys3nMsqqpmZOaenN8kG5oaW4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./new-crystal-goddess-switch-nsp.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>(New) Crystal Goddess Switch NSP (eShop)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kenya-moores-photo-of-baby-girl-brooklyn-daly-will-brighten-your-day-402783.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kenya Moores Photo Of Baby Girl, Brooklyn Daly Will Brighten Your Day</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alyson-stoner-reveals-she-attended-gay-conversion-therapy-there-are-scars-there.html>Alyson Stoner Reveals She Attended 'Gay Conversion' Therapy: 'There Are Scars There'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./104379-7-true-facts-gina-carano-a-husband-html.html>7 true facts about Gina Carano: does she have a husband?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./objective-crossword-clue-6-letters-answer-trending-1244063.html>Objective Crossword Clue 6 letters Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./audrey-hepburn-is-voted-the-ultimate-beauty-icon-of-all-time-plus-see-who-else-made-the-top-10-48983.html>Audrey Hepburn is Voted the Ultimate Beauty Icon of All Time Plus See Who Else Made the Top 10!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-mel-coleman-meet-annabel-croft-husband-married-life-and-tragic-death.html>Who Is Mel Coleman?
