The actress is currently starring in Maggie, a supernatural drama streaming on Hulu. The titular character is a psychic who gets a glimpse at her own future and realizes she needs to start making some changes to her present. Bridges plays Jessie, one of Maggie’s friends.&nbsp;</p><p>She’s also hard at work on a movie, as well. Bridges is set to star in Skate God. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>, “OREN, a skateboarder in a Dystopian future, comes into self-discovery that he is the descendant of a Greek God and is plunged into a battle with a Gothicized Fallen society that wants to turn the outside world into hell on earth.”</p><p>Bridges is set to play Azura, the villain of the movie. The project is still in pre-production, so little is known about the details of the plot. Fans of Bridges can’t wait to see her on the big screen again!</p><h2><strong>Chloe Bridges and Adam DeVine’s relationship</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Bridges didn’t just work on The Final Girls; she also found love. The actor met co-star Adam DeVine while working on the meta-horror movie, and they began dating shortly after. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Us</a>, the actress revealed how she knew the comedian was The One.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don’t know if this is too personal, but the moment I knew he was The One was actually during a disagreement we had early in our relationship,” Bridges explained. “He said something along the lines of, ‘We got to figure it out because breaking up is not an option.’”</p><p>She continued, “I was like, ‘Wow, I really respect that.’ I think that’s an attitude he got from his parents’ successful marriage. No matter what happens, you stick it out. You figure it out.”</p><p>In 2019, the couple announced their engagement. Bridges and DeVine tied the knot in 2021. The pair had to keep pushing their wedding back due to pandemic delays, but they eventually walked down the aisle in an intimate beachside ceremony in Cabo San Lucas.&nbsp;</p><p>“I cried the whole damn time,” DeVine told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vogue</a>. “I didn’t expect that, but seeing Chloe in her gown was all it took.” Bridges chimed in, saying, “I felt so present and so surrounded by love.”</p><p>The couple has continued to team up onscreen, co-starring in movies like Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates and Game Over, Man!, as well as the hit HBO show <a href=#>The Righteous Gemstones</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>2020 Even Got To ‘Relentlessly Positive’ Adam Devine—But He’s Leaving ‘Cynicism’ Behind and Ready To Party Into the New Year</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOsJ%2BarF2ewG6vx6WmnmWSp7als8SsZJ2nmaO0brrOsGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./trey-songz-tests-positive-for-covid-19-see-his-message-to-fans-443228.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Trey Songz Tests Positive For COVID-19 See His Message To Fans</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jeff-simmons.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jeff Simmons - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alyson-stoner-reveals-she-attended-gay-conversion-therapy-there-are-scars-there.html>Alyson Stoner Reveals She Attended 'Gay Conversion' Therapy: 'There Are Scars There'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./104379-7-true-facts-gina-carano-a-husband-html.html>7 true facts about Gina Carano: does she have a husband?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./objective-crossword-clue-6-letters-answer-trending-1244063.html>Objective Crossword Clue 6 letters Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./audrey-hepburn-is-voted-the-ultimate-beauty-icon-of-all-time-plus-see-who-else-made-the-top-10-48983.html>Audrey Hepburn is Voted the Ultimate Beauty Icon of All Time Plus See Who Else Made the Top 10!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-mel-coleman-meet-annabel-croft-husband-married-life-and-tragic-death.html>Who Is Mel Coleman?
