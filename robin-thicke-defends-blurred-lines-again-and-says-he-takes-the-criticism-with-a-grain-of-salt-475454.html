Furthermore, the singer revealed that when it comes to this single, he takes the criticism with a grain of salt.</p><p>As you might remember, Blurred Lines was released back in 2013 and ever since then, both Robin and Pharrell Williams, have been involved in controversy over the lyrics as well as other reasons!</p><p>For instance, in 2015, the two artists were ordered to give credit posthumously for the writing of the song, to Marvin Gaye after they were found guilty of copyright infringement.</p><p>The whole process of creating the song was also a reason for controversy since Robin first claimed that he had a big role in it only to be later revealed that was not the case.</p><p>During the trial, as per Hollywood Reporter, he admitted: ‘I was jealous and wanted some of the credit … I tried to take credit for it because [Williams] wrote the whole thing pretty much by himself and I was envious of that.’</p><p>But most famously, it has been criticized for its lyrics which caused the song to be banned from no less than 20 universities in the U.K.</p><p>After all, it seemingly promotes date rape and other instances in which consent is ignored.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>While chatting with Zane Lowe on Apple Music, Robin defended the song like he’s done many times before, however, insisting that ‘I never saw it that way when I performed it. Usually, it goes, ‘Bum, bum, bum, everybody get up,’ and the whole crowd goes crazy. Even people who aren’t big fans of mine, that is the only [song] they know. You kind of just take it with a grain of salt. We’re just jamming, everybody’s meant to get up and dance. That is all the song is meant to do.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeipK%2Bquoytn6Kbm5p6pbHFnqWdq12Xuba%2B0Z6bZqSZo7K0ecCgmKKmXZa7pXnSmrCsZZiaerWtyp6qZqyYmnqkvsitoJyho6J6uLXToWSaZZenrqq6jKidZquRocFugJZua25sXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jeff-simmons.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jeff Simmons - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./evan-rachel-wood-alleges-ex-fiance-marilyn-manson-horrifically-abused-me-for-years.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Evan Rachel Wood alleges ex-fianc Marilyn Manson 'horrifically abused me for years'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alyson-stoner-reveals-she-attended-gay-conversion-therapy-there-are-scars-there.html>Alyson Stoner Reveals She Attended 'Gay Conversion' Therapy: 'There Are Scars There'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./104379-7-true-facts-gina-carano-a-husband-html.html>7 true facts about Gina Carano: does she have a husband?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./objective-crossword-clue-6-letters-answer-trending-1244063.html>Objective Crossword Clue 6 letters Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./audrey-hepburn-is-voted-the-ultimate-beauty-icon-of-all-time-plus-see-who-else-made-the-top-10-48983.html>Audrey Hepburn is Voted the Ultimate Beauty Icon of All Time Plus See Who Else Made the Top 10!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-mel-coleman-meet-annabel-croft-husband-married-life-and-tragic-death.html>Who Is Mel Coleman?
