It was beyond epic and inspiring. This place is absolute heaven — no wonder Marlon Brando worshipped it.”</p><p>Actor Sterling Jones has also been posting Instagram Stories from the Rebel Island birthday trip as a guest, as has “Entertainment Tonight” host Carly Steel.</p><p>Wilson also captioned a shot on Instagram of herself with two more pals, “Zahra is one of my besties from high school who now crushes it as a lawyer in Manhattan and Lorelei is my former Youth Ambassador friend (when we toured Southern Africa) who now works literally for world peace. And they’re both Moms who crush it every day!”</p><p>The group was wearing lots of neon colors on the beach for the ’80s-themed party — with slimmed-down Wilson donning a hot pink top that said “Let’s Get Physical.” Pals also seemed to be outfitted with some fun Rebel Island swag.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The Brando is the same spot where <a href=#>Kim Kardashian celebrated her 40th birthday</a> last year with her family, and DiCaprio celebrated his 42nd birthday in 2016 with his mom and then-girlfriend Nina Agdal.</p><p>The resort on late Hollywood icon Brando’s private Tetiaroa atoll in French Polynesia includes “35 villas on white-sand beaches frequented by sea turtles, manta rays and exotic birds.” It also reportedly utilizes solar energy and “seawater air conditioning,” with the goal of having “zero carbon impact.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnopqvpriMsKClq5%2BjeqSxy56Zq5mknruoeZNqqq1lkp6%2FtbTDmrBmp55iuqK%2By6ilZpqilrulu9Jmp6uhppbBpnnIrKOappRk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./money-paid-to-the-government-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Money paid to the government</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./news-marissa-lawrence-in-bathing-suit-shows-off-summer-uniform.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Marissa Lawrence in Bathing Suit Shows Off &amp;quot;Summer Uniform&amp;quot; Celebwell</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alyson-stoner-reveals-she-attended-gay-conversion-therapy-there-are-scars-there.html>Alyson Stoner Reveals She Attended 'Gay Conversion' Therapy: 'There Are Scars There'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./104379-7-true-facts-gina-carano-a-husband-html.html>7 true facts about Gina Carano: does she have a husband?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./objective-crossword-clue-6-letters-answer-trending-1244063.html>Objective Crossword Clue 6 letters Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./audrey-hepburn-is-voted-the-ultimate-beauty-icon-of-all-time-plus-see-who-else-made-the-top-10-48983.html>Audrey Hepburn is Voted the Ultimate Beauty Icon of All Time Plus See Who Else Made the Top 10!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-mel-coleman-meet-annabel-croft-husband-married-life-and-tragic-death.html>Who Is Mel Coleman?
