According to studies, the tallest men in the Arab region are the Lebanese, with an average male height of 176cm. This is followed by the Saudi Arabians, with an average height of 174cm. Going further, research conducted in 2019 on male beauty by IPSOS, multinational market research, revealed that over 41% of the Saudi Arabian despondent prefer their men to be between 5 feet 10 inches (178cm) and 6 feet 1 inch (185cm).</p><p>From the same research, it is known that an average Saudi Arabian man stands at 5 feet 7 inches (172cm), while the average Saudi woman stands at 5 feet 2inches.
