Hoeffel,</strong> who died on December 19, 2023, was a great guy who affected many people’s lives.

Friends and neighbors contributed old bikes, which Peter turned into functional and cheap bicycles for others to enjoy. Despite personal challenges, Peter stayed committed to giving back and making a positive influence in the lives of others around him.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/eter-Hoeffel-Obituary1-1.jpg><h2><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Peter Hoeffel Obituary 2023: Cause Of Death, Family Mourns"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14915,"3":{"1":0},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"9":0,"12":0,"14":{"1":2,"2":0},"15":"Arial","16":12}'>Peter Hoeffel Obituary News 2023</span></h2><p><strong>The passing of Peter G.
