about gay players during a press conference.</strong></p><p>During a media conference before Morocco’s Women’s World Cup match against Germany, a BBC reporter sparked controversy.</p><p>He asked the captain of the Morocco women’s national team, Ghizlane Chebbak, about gay players on the squad and the situation for them in a country where same-sex relationships are illegal.</p><p>The question was deemed inappropriate and political, prompting the press conference moderator to intervene and steer the discussion back to football-related inquiries.</p><p>The BBC later apologized for the question, acknowledging its unsuitability in a sports context and the need to focus on the tournament and players’ athletic abilities.</p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=# rel="bookmark noopener">Britney

national team.</p><p>The male reporter questioned whether there were any gay players in her squad, despite same-sex relationships being illegal in Morocco, a North African country.</p><p>The uncomfortable inquiry led to a FIFA media representative intervening, stating that it was a political question and requesting a focus on football-related inquiries.</p><img

question was not political but about people and urged Chebbak to respond.</p><p>The incident drew widespread criticism, with critics denouncing the unethical nature of the question, asserting that it was completely out of line and posed safety concerns for the players.</p><p>In response to the controversy, the BBC issued a statement apologizing for the inappropriate question, emphasizing that
