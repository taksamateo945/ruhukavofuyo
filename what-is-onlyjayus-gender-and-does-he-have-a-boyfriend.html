Having later come out as gay, Isabella Avila, as her real name says, has dated at least two same-sex partners, but she has never been associated with any boyfriend.</strong></p><h2><strong>Is OnlyJayus Gay?</strong></h2><p>Yes, OnlyJayus is gay. The popular TikToker identifies as lesbian and her preferred pronouns have been revealed to be “they” or “them.” The Californian native’s relationship history revealed that she has dated several members of the LGBTQ community who identify as gender-neutral.</p><p>OnlyJayus told a tale about her outing, the TikToker said she was still a teenager when she declared herself to be openly gay. Her declaration attracted a lot of hate from people around her especially her parents whom she said mistreated her so much. The internet personality didn’t bother to reveal how she settled the issues of her sexuality with her family but she appears to be on good terms with them.</p><h2><strong>Is OnlyJayus Transgender?</strong></h2><p>OnlyJayus is not transgender. Isabella Avila came into the world as a female and there are no reports that she has gone through any transformation.</p><p>OnlyJayus’s preferred sexual orientation, which is said to be gay, has put the Californian lady into a lot of trouble in the course of her career in the internet space. In 2021, the social media influencer had it hot from her fans and the general public when a leaked personal message from her revealed some unpalatable stuff about racism and the LGBTQ community.</p><p>The evidence that she uttered those slurs was so overwhelming that both her fans and the general public joined efforts in giving her heat, some even requested that all her social media handles de-platform her via a lot of petitions.</p><p>In a bid to save her neck and her social media career, OnlyJayus released an apology video confirming that the text messages actually leaked from her and asking for forgiveness. Isabella said the messages were composed years ago and have no reflection on the kind of person she has become today. While many accepted her apology, a good number of people didn’t believe she sounded sincere enough.</p><p>With all that said, Avila’s current standing with fans and the public is unclear and she just had to trade carefully. However, she has remained faithful to the gay community and has continued creating content that resonates with them</p><h2><strong>Who Is OnlyJayus Dating?</strong></h2><p>In recent times, OnlyJayus appears to be dating another social media star called Brittany Lee @brittanydejardo with whom she has been sharing pictures and videos on social media. However, she has dated two other girls in the past.</p><p>In 2020, the social media sensation was revealed to be having a same-sex relationship with a girl who is simply known as Hail Lightning. The lady’s real name has remained undisclosed to date; Hail Lightning is just a moniker she uses in some of her handles on social media.</p><p>The same-sex couple’s relationship became public knowledge on Valentine’s Day of 2020. With a series of their loved-up images and videos on Instagram, OnlyJayus wished @h_lightning a Happy Valentine’s Day, thanking her for laughing at her bad jokes and lending her support no matter the circumstances. The TikToker also expressed her gratitude to @h_lightning for making her the happiest she has ever been and she ended the post with “I love you”</p><p>Fans later saw a deluge of images and videos of the couple on each other’s socials. However, the duo’s relationship couldn’t stand the test of time as they soon broke up</p><p>The next time Onlyjayus appeared on the love scene was in 2022 when she started going steady with another TikTok star called, Mattie Westbrouck; Mattie also has a presence on several other social media platforms. However, Avilla did not conduct this particular relationship in the open like she did the last time, thus, nothing much is known about them, though they are said to have gone their separate ways.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMSprdNmoKxln6O5urbAsqysZZeau6Wx0WaYp5xdmbymv4yhnGagkauybq2Mm6aynqKesq%2Bwjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./off-theft-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>___-off (theft)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./booking-for-a-stand-up-comedian-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Booking for a stand-up comedian</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alyson-stoner-reveals-she-attended-gay-conversion-therapy-there-are-scars-there.html>Alyson Stoner Reveals She Attended 'Gay Conversion' Therapy: 'There Are Scars There'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./104379-7-true-facts-gina-carano-a-husband-html.html>7 true facts about Gina Carano: does she have a husband?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./objective-crossword-clue-6-letters-answer-trending-1244063.html>Objective Crossword Clue 6 letters Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./audrey-hepburn-is-voted-the-ultimate-beauty-icon-of-all-time-plus-see-who-else-made-the-top-10-48983.html>Audrey Hepburn is Voted the Ultimate Beauty Icon of All Time Plus See Who Else Made the Top 10!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-mel-coleman-meet-annabel-croft-husband-married-life-and-tragic-death.html>Who Is Mel Coleman?
