The 32-year-old appeared on Jimmy Kimmel’s show last night to talk about Game Of Thrones, alluding to the episode, “The Long Night.”</p><p>While at an Academy Awards afterparty, Emilia found out Beyonce was there and she was a big fan of the show. In the video clip below, you can see Emilia describe the story in detail.</p><p>During the interaction, Clarke began, there was a moment where she might’ve made the weirdest noise She said, “I think I started crying, exactly that noise came out of my mouth,” and Bey suddenly acted like the conversation became incredibly awkward and she had to leave.</p><p></p><p>Emilia went on to say that she’s a huge fan of Beyonce Knowles, and it breaks her heart because she messed up her chance at meeting her. As you may know, Beyonce is a big favorite among people in the entertainment industry, with stars and musicians frequently capitulating to the former Destiny’s Child member.</p><p>The last star to admit a cringe-worthy story about meeting Beyonce was Tiffany Haddish, who admitted to starting a fight with another Hollywood actress who supposedly bit Beyoncé’s face. Beyoncé was doing her best to calm Tiffany down, and Haddish told her she would relax only if Bey took a picture.</p><p>In the photo, Beyonce hides her face ever-so-slight while Tiffany smiles in the picture. Leslie Jones, as well, took a picture with Beyonce one time and wrote in the caption, “I was so nervous.” Cringe-worthy capitulation or not, Beyonce performed at Coachella last year and since then, her star power has only grown.</p><p>Moreover, the birth of her two twins with her husband, Jay-Z – Rumi Carter, and Sir Carter – saw the singer propelled to the position of holding the Instagram record for most likes.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Interestingly, Emilia has every right to feel more than equal to Beyonce, considering she has a starring role on one of the most successful TV series of all time.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeVorattcBmmqWZoqCybrDIrJ%2Beq12ku260xKtknaGjlsC1vs6uqmadnpi8trrTnqlmr5mptW6uxLKmp5uVYn94g5htb2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nagma-mirajkar-phone-number.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nagma Mirajkar Phone Number WhatsApp Number Contact Num Mobile</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alyson-stoner-reveals-she-attended-gay-conversion-therapy-there-are-scars-there.html>Alyson Stoner Reveals She Attended 'Gay Conversion' Therapy: 'There Are Scars There'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./104379-7-true-facts-gina-carano-a-husband-html.html>7 true facts about Gina Carano: does she have a husband?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./objective-crossword-clue-6-letters-answer-trending-1244063.html>Objective Crossword Clue 6 letters Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./audrey-hepburn-is-voted-the-ultimate-beauty-icon-of-all-time-plus-see-who-else-made-the-top-10-48983.html>Audrey Hepburn is Voted the Ultimate Beauty Icon of All Time Plus See Who Else Made the Top 10!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-mel-coleman-meet-annabel-croft-husband-married-life-and-tragic-death.html>Who Is Mel Coleman?
