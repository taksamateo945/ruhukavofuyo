"He's not [taking advantage of me]," Saved by the Bell's Voorhies, 41, told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> on July 8 in a joint interview with her husband of three months. "We're selectively together for all the right reasons."</p><p>Voorhies' comments come two weeks after her mother, Patricia Voorhies, filed a restraining order against her new son-in-law. According to Patricia, she was forced to file after music producer Green continued to sleep at her home and argue with her. Green and his new mother-in-law had made an agreement that he would spend nights at his own home. In the paperwork obtained by TMZ, Patricia reportedly once found Green asleep in her closet, and after waking him up, Green allegedly yelled: “You motherf–king woke me up, ain't that a bitch."</p><p>Since then, Lark told ET, her mother has warmed up to her son-in-law and feels differently about their quickie marriage. "The support was there. It's all celebratory,” Voorhies said. In her <a href=#>original filing</a>, <a href=#>Patricia said</a> Lark lived with her because she was "psychologically, mentally, and emotionally fragile," all claims which her daughter denied. "I've always been mentally healthy," said the former child star.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Green also had a chance to speak out to defend himself and the bond he has with his new bride. "We're the same as any other couple out there that's in love and trying to accomplish business together," said Green, who is helping Voorhies record an album. "It's not a scam or a way to get money."</p><p>Voorhies and Green met on Facebook and dated for more than a year before marrying in April 2015. They first held a commitment ceremony on April 1, and later walked down the aisle at a Las Vegas wedding chapel on April 30.</p><p>Following their April 30 wedding, reports of Green's alleged gang affiliation surfaced, with TMZ reporting that Green is wanted in Arizona after a 2012 incident in which he allegedly threatened to kill a store owner. "We are obviously concerned about the allegations and we are looking into the matter," Voorhies' rep Jennifer Wolfson previously told <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a>. "Lark feels these allegations are not true and would like this cleared up as soon as possible."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKOaqptiw7C70aGgnqtdmbKnsc2dqmamlax6qcHSm5innF2Ws7Wx0WakqKVdm7atsdJmqZ6rpKeuqrrIp55mp6KZsrN5kWlobnFn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tom-fogerty.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tom Fogerty</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./britt-nilsson-splits-from-former-bachelorette-contestant-brady-toops-2015147.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Britt Nilsson Splits From Former Bachelorette Contestant Brady Toops</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alyson-stoner-reveals-she-attended-gay-conversion-therapy-there-are-scars-there.html>Alyson Stoner Reveals She Attended 'Gay Conversion' Therapy: 'There Are Scars There'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./104379-7-true-facts-gina-carano-a-husband-html.html>7 true facts about Gina Carano: does she have a husband?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./objective-crossword-clue-6-letters-answer-trending-1244063.html>Objective Crossword Clue 6 letters Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./audrey-hepburn-is-voted-the-ultimate-beauty-icon-of-all-time-plus-see-who-else-made-the-top-10-48983.html>Audrey Hepburn is Voted the Ultimate Beauty Icon of All Time Plus See Who Else Made the Top 10!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-mel-coleman-meet-annabel-croft-husband-married-life-and-tragic-death.html>Who Is Mel Coleman?
